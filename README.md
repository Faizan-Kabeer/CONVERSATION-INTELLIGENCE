🎙️ Conversation Intelligence API
=================================

An enterprise-ready, API-first backend system designed to analyze multimodal customer conversations (audio recordings or text transcripts). It leverages advanced AI to extract structured business insights, detect compliance violations, and generate risk scores based on configurable, client-specific business rules.

✨ Core Features
---------------

*   **Multimodal Input Handling:** Accept either raw audio files (.wav, .mp3) or text-based conversation transcripts.
    
*   **Auto-Language Detection & Diarization:** Automatically identifies the spoken language and separates speakers (Customer vs. Agent) using AssemblyAI's state-of-the-art models.
    
*   **Multi-Tenant Client Context:** Automatically injects specific business rules, policies, and risk triggers into the AI analysis based on the authenticated client's API key.
    
*   **Advanced Compliance & Risk Analysis:** Utilizes Google Gemini to flag policy violations, detect risky behaviors (e.g., scam attempts, unauthorized tools), and objectively score the call outcome.
    
*   **Strict Structured Output:** Guarantees a fully structured JSON response ready for enterprise database ingestion or frontend consumption.
    

🛠️ Tech Stack
--------------

*   **Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python)
    
*   **Audio Processing:** [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/) (universal-3-pro & universal-2 models)
    
*   **Intelligence Engine:** Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash via the new google-genai SDK)
    
*   **Data Validation & Serialization:** Pydantic

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+ installed on your system.
* API keys for AssemblyAI and Google Gemini.

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to run this project inside an isolated virtual environment to prevent package conflicts.

**Windows:**

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

The system relies on secure API keys to function. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project:

```plaintext
# External AI Services  
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key_here  
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here  

# Local API Security (Used for authenticating your clients)  
MY_BACKEND_API_KEY=finance-corp-key-123
```

*(Note: Ensure `.env` is added to your `.gitignore` file).*

### 5. Start the Server

Start the FastAPI backend using the Uvicorn server. We specify `--port 8080` to prevent common Windows socket access errors (`[WinError 10013]`).

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

If successful, the terminal will display: `INFO: Application startup complete.`

## 🚀 Usage & API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates an interactive Swagger UI. Once the server is running, navigate to:

### Example: Testing via Python Client

You can test the machine-to-machine integration using the provided `client.py` script. Ensure `rec1.wav` is in the same directory.

```python
import requests
import json

url = "[http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/analyze/audio](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/analyze/audio)"

# The server looks up this key to apply the correct Client Context business rules
headers = {
    "X-API-Key": "finance-corp-key-123"
}

with open("rec1.wav", "rb") as audio_file:
    files_payload = {"file": audio_file}
    print("Uploading audio... Please wait.")
    
    response = requests.post(url, files=files_payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    
    print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
```

### Example: Testing via cURL

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  '[http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/analyze/audio](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/analyze/audio)' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: finance-corp-key-123' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  -F 'file=@rec1.wav'
```

🧠 Design Decisions & Assumptions
---------------------------------

1.  **FastAPI for the Backend:** Chosen for its native asynchronous capabilities. Audio transcription and LLM generation are heavy I/O tasks; FastAPI's async/await ensures the server remains responsive to other requests while waiting for these third-party APIs.
    
2.  **Separation of Services:** Audio processing (audio\_processor.py) and Intelligence (intelligence.py) are decoupled into distinct service classes. This allows either provider (e.g., swapping AssemblyAI for OpenAI Whisper) to be changed in the future without rewriting the core API routes.
    
3.  **Dependency Injection for Client Context:** Instead of forcing clients to pass their business rules in every single API request, the system uses FastAPI's Depends to securely look up the client's configuration based on their X-API-Key. This mimics a secure, multi-tenant B2B architecture, preventing malicious injection of relaxed compliance rules.
    
4.  **Gemini Native JSON Mode:** We utilize the response\_mime\_type="application/json" configuration in the google-genai SDK. This forces the LLM to strictly adhere to the Pydantic schema, eliminating conversational filler and guaranteeing an enterprise-ready data structure.
    
5.  **Assumptions:** \* The system assumes uploaded audio files are of reasonable length (under ~30 minutes) for synchronous HTTP processing. For massive enterprise files, an asynchronous background task + webhook architecture would be required.
    

    *   It assumes the X-API-Key maps correctly to a valid ClientContext dictionary/database entry.
